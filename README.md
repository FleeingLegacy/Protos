FleeingLegacy-Protos
====================
 This repository contains some [protobuf]("https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers") files, which will be used in FleeingLegacy software.  

 `CBT#` stands for `Coolest and Biggest Thruster version #`, for sure, no doubt, because we're *fleeing*.

 Protobuf files generated using [ProtoDumper](https://github.com/nitrog0d/ProtoDumper) with [some modifications](https://github.com/FleeingLegacy/ProtoDumper-CBT).
